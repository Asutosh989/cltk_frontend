# Notice

The Classics Archive application is currently under active development and is not ready for production.

# About  

The goal of this application is to provide a modern reading environment for documents included in the CLTK corpora. Dev builds will be put up at http://api.cltk.org for the early stages of development.  Currently all demo data in the application is static, but in the future, text data will be consumed by the API under development at this repository: https://github.com/cltk/cltk_api


# Development

The CLTK frontend reading environment is built with Meteor and React.  

Very briefly, to get started developing, first [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install).  Then clone this repo and in the application root directory run "meteor" to start the application.

For managing lists of outstanding development items, we're using ZenHub: https://www.zenhub.io/.  If you're interested in contributing, please consider installing the ZenHub plugin for your browser.
